A WIP Psionics mod for Cataclysm: Darker Days Ahead

This mod adds (currently) five separate psionic power paths to Cataclysm, including:

1) Biokinesis - Control of autonomic processes 
2) Clairisentience
3) Telekinesis
4) Telepathy
5) Teleportation
6) Vitakinesis - Control of health and 

The goal is for each path to be upgraded through usage, since sitting and studying a book for hours doesn't really fit the fiction of improving psychic powers. Powers are gained progressively, with increasing mastery of lower-tier powers unlocking new ones. 

ADVANTAGES

1) Psionic powers are fast. Many powers take less than 100 moves to use, with high-level powers sometimes taking much less (a level 10 Telekinetic Hand takes on 10 moves!), reflecting that they are as fast as thought
2) Powers use Stamina as their power source, meaning that a fully-charged psychic is only a five-minute breather away. 

DISADVANTAGES

1) Powers use Stamina as their power source. This is also a disadvantage because every power use reduces your ability to run away. 
2) All powers require concentation and thus are affected by Focus. It's very difficult to concentrate enough to lift a pursuing boomer if you've just fought off  a grappler in close range and there's blood all around you.
